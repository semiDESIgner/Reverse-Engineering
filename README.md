Reverse Engineering Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I take existing products from the market, reverse engineer them, and redesign them to be more cost-effective while integrating new and innovative features. My goal is to make technology more accessible and functional, offering unique improvements over the original designs.
